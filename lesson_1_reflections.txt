How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
diff helped because it gave a clear picture of what was deleted or edited from the first file and its line number and the corresponding changed versions in the new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
This will help to go back to a version where:
1. Either parts of it worked better than the new version
2. To find any typos in the new version
3. To compare and fix things or to reuse code from the past.
