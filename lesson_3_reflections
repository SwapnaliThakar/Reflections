Create reflections file for lesson 3 about using git and github on Udacity
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to collaborate with others so that we can all contribute to the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If we pull or push automatically then it will have versions of the code that is not ready for the public yet.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks - clones that exist on only on GitHub
Clones - clones that can exist locally or remotely
Branches - are simply local
